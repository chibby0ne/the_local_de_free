# the_local_de_free

A very simple Firefox extension for reading premium articles in the
[thelocal.de](http://www.thelocal.de).

**PSA: If you can, please support your favorite websites or at least whitelist
them from your ad-blocker. Thank you**

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone nor encourage the use.... ah who I am kidding?
Information should be free!

## To install

You should go and install it directly from the [Firefox Add-ons
Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/thelocal-de-free/)

If you don't want to do that for some reason, or you simply can't you can also
install it using the [about:debugging](about:debugging) page.

Open that page in your firefox and select **Load Temporary Add-on** then
navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, and click any of
the files contained in the `manifest.json`.

The only caveat of installing it this way is that when you close Firefox, the
add-on is no longer installed, and you would have to repeat the process.

Now enjoy the articles for free (*while you can*)!
